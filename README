This is an Another World (Out Of This World in North America)
interpreter codebase. This work is based on:

- Piotr Padkowski's newRaw interpreter which was based on
- Gregory Montoir's reverse engineering of
- Eric Chahi's assembly code.

I cleaned up a lot of the code, removing cryptic hexadecimal notation
with meaninful macros name. I also cleanup a lot of the code so it has a 
C/C++ philosophy instead of an assembly structure.

I also created a Visual Studio 2010 project.

TODO:

Create a MacOS X project.
Add a different rendering path OpenGL support.
